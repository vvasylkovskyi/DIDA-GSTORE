## Run a Project

Open project at the root folder and type 
`dotnet run`

## Publish Server/Client

To produce the executable file from Client or Server projects (the one to be used to start the process), you need to **publish** a project. To do so, run the following command

`dotnet publish --configuration Release` 

This will publish the project to both `bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1` and `bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1` folders.
